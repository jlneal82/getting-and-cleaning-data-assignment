Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed 
six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) 
on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at
a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly 
partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding 
windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion 
components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to 
have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was 
obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

-Merge the two sets


Section 2:  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Create a logic vector using TRUE values, keep only desired columns


Section 3:  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
-Merge the finalData set with the acitivityType to include descriptive activity names


Section 4:  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

colNames[i] = gsub("\\()","",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("-std$","StdDev",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("-mean","Mean",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("^(t)","time",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("^(f)","freq",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("([Gg]ravity)","Gravity",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("([Bb]ody[Bb]ody|[Bb]ody)","Body",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("[Gg]yro","Gyro",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("AccMag","AccMagnitude",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("([Bb]odyaccjerkmag)","BodyAccJerkMagnitude",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("JerkMag","JerkMagnitude",colNames[i]) 
    colNames[i] = gsub("GyroMag","GyroMagnitude",colNames[i]) 
    
    -Use gsub to clean data labels
    
Section 5:  Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
-Produce a data set with an average per variable
